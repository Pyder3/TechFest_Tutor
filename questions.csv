Given a sorted array `nums` of integers, remove the duplicates **in-place** such that each element appears only once and returns the new length of the array. Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

**Example Input and Output:**

- Input: `nums = [1,1,2]`
- Output: Length = 2, nums = [1,2,_]
- Explanation: Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of `nums` being 1 and 2 respectively. The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

**Expected Input Format:**

The only input to your function will be an array of integers, where each integer is separated by a comma.

```
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  // Your code here
}
```

- **`nums`** is an array of integers (e.g., `[0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]`).

- The first line contains an integer, `m`, the number of elements initially in `arr1`.
- The second line contains `m` integers separated by spaces, representing the elements of `arr1`.
- The third line contains an integer, `n`, the number of elements in `arr2`.
- The fourth line contains `n` integers separated by spaces, representing the elements of `arr2`.

#### Example Input:

```plaintext
3
1 2 3
3
2 5 6
```

#### Explanation:

In this example, the first array `arr1` initially contains 3 elements `[1, 2, 3]`. After merging `arr2` `[2, 5, 6]` into `arr1`, `arr1` becomes `[1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6]`. This is the sorted array that should be the result of your code solution.","{'input': '```plaintext41 2 3 40```', 'output': '```plaintext1 2 3 4```'}"
easy,"### Problem Statement: Merge Sorted Arrays

You are given two sorted arrays, `arr1` and `arr2`, where `arr1` has a sufficient size at the end to hold `arr2`. The number of elements initially in `arr1` and `arr2` are `m` and `n`, respectively. Merge `arr2` into `arr1` so that `arr1` becomes a single sorted array. You should achieve this without using any extra space (i.e., do not allocate another array), and the final sorted array should be stored in `arr1`.
 
**Note**: You may assume that `arr1` has enough space to hold additional elements from `arr2`, and the lengths `m` and `n` refer to the number of elements initially in `arr1` and `arr2`, respectively.

### Expected Input Format

- The first line contains an integer, `m`, the number of elements initially in `arr1`.
- The second line contains `m` integers separated by spaces, representing the elements of `arr1`.
- The third line contains an integer, `n`, the number of elements in `arr2`.
- The fourth line contains `n` integers separated by spaces, representing the elements of `arr2`.
